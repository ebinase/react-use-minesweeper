# Minesweeper Custom Hook

A React custom hook that provides the game logic for Minesweeper.

## Overview

This hook provides the core mechanics for Minesweeper using only standard React APIs. It simplifies the integration of Minesweeper logic into your React applications, allowing you to concentrate on the UI and UX.

## Background

This hook is derived from my Next.js application, [ebinase/mine-sweeper](https://github.com/ebinase/mine-sweeper). Its purpose is to separate the Minesweeper game logic from the UI, enabling easy implementation of Minesweeper in your projects.
